Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the IRS put back the deadline for individual returns in March, allowing most Americans an additional month to register.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the extra time, many Americans put off planning and filing their taxes, an already perplexing process was made more so by the healthcare crisis and legislation passed in the middle of the filing season this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allison Koester, a former CPA, and associate professor at Georgetown University&#39;s McDonough School of Business, said, &quot;It&#39;s always necessary to file your taxes; it&#39;s your duty.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to demand any IRS refund is one of the most compelling reasons to file a tax return. The IRS has submitted more than 121 million individual tax returns and processed more than 110 million of them as of April 30. The IRS has issued over 81 million tax refund checks to Americans, with an average check of $2,865.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Families also earn the biggest windfall of the year in the form of a refund, which can be used to pay down debt, increase savings, and more. Americans can demand any money they are owed, particularly after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Rebecca Thompson, director of the Taxpayer Opportunity Channel at Prosperity Now, a nonprofit, it is crucial to note that a refund is not free money. It is money you owe the US government because you overpaid them, an interest-free loan. You have the right to have it returned, and you should do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the deadline for filing taxes for this year is May 17, it is also the deadline for claiming any refunds from 2017. The IRS gives taxpayers three years to seek refunds. The IRS announced in April that $1.3 billion in unclaimed refunds from 2017 remained unclaimed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If they don&#39;t [file], the money is lost, and it becomes a treasury donation,&rdquo; Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get your hands on those credits, and a lot more.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other reasons this year why filing with the IRS is relevant, even for those who do not usually do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For one thing, filing a return and receiving the recovery refund credit is the only way to get any economic benefit payments owed to you, or to get a &ldquo;topped up&rdquo; sum if your circumstances changed &ndash; for example if you had a baby in 2020 and were eligible for a stimulus check.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax reforms were also introduced as part of the American Rescue Plan. For the millions of Americans who lose their jobs because of Covid, the first $10,200 in unemployment insurance is now tax-free for those earning less than $150,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extensions and Penalties&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not file, you risk losing your refund and incurring fines and interest if you owe the IRS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is important for anybody who believes they would owe to make sure that their tax return is filed or that an extension is filed and approved by the IRS, and that they do so by the filing deadline,&rdquo; Thompson said. &ldquo;If they don&#39;t, they&#39;ll face fines for failing to register and paying.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, even though you file an extension, you can still be subject to penalties for failing to pay your taxes, according to her. Whether you file an extension or not, the payment deadline is May 17.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, some people find that filing an extension is beneficial because the penalty for paying what you owe late is usually minor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&#39;s no shame in asking for an extension,&rdquo; Koester said. To get an extension, you must fill out IRS Form 4868. After that, you have until October 15 to register.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Just get it over with.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to many online services that assist people in preparing and submitting their returns, filing taxes has never been simpler in several respects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You still have time to gather your documents and file before the deadline,&rdquo; said TurboTax tax expert Lisa Greene-Lewis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>There is no shame in requesting a postponement.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>She suggests collecting all payroll statements, valid Social Security numbers for you and your dependents, correct bank records, and receipts for charitable contributions or things to subtract to ensure that planning and filing your return goes smoothly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also suggests filing electronically and choosing a direct deposit for any refund due because it is the quickest way to send your details and receive your money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thompson concurs. She said, &quot;The IRS does not want your paper to return.&quot;&nbsp;</p>', 'You Just Have a Few Days To File 2020 Taxes', 'The clock is ticking if you have not completed your 2020 tax return yet.

Furthermore, he said that technological advancements and a transition to one-party control of Congress and the White House could have an impact on the FASB&#39;s future course.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics of Interest&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones&#39; latest interview also sheds light on the FASB&#39;s existing project list, which contains the following high priority initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization),&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure laws, are non-GAAP steps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presentation of the cash flow statement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>debt classification,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>goodwill,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>government aid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>segment reporting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones said the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board have &ldquo;great communication&rdquo; when asked about the status of global convergence initiatives (IASB). He intends to collaborate with the IASB on &quot;projects of shared interest&quot; in the&nbsp;future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After-Implementation Evaluations</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones emphasized during the interview that FASB requirements are subject to &quot;continuous change.&quot; As a result, he intends to perform a post-implementation analysis of the recently adopted revised requirements for revenue, rentals, and credit losses. After being implemented by public companies, these major programs usually require fine-tuning to make the guidelines more effective and to make it easier for smaller organizations to comply with the changes. The evaluation process normally takes several years, and the FASB is just beginning to look at these criteria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Jones discussed the effect of technology, such as artificial intelligence and software advancements, on the FASB&#39;s standard-setting process. He pointed out that technology has made it easier for investors to access and process vast amounts of data, resulting in a need for more disaggregated&nbsp;reporting..&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the FASB has been relatively quiet as businesses worked to implement changes to the revenue, rents, and credit losses requirements.

A suitable strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://cpapai.com/service/tax-planning\">Tax planning</a>&nbsp;is a legal way to minimize your tax package for the financial year. This allows you to access tax privileges, deductions, and considerations that the government provides to those who take advantage of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In simpler words, through the lens of a tax specialist, it is the study of the financial situation and the catch of money-saving opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Where does it fit into tax planning?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A key part of an overall detailed financial strategy is tax preparation. If you live in a state that is not taxable (there are few, if any), it is important to prepare to save the most tax money. The advantage of working with a trusted advisor is to do so while staying in agreement with local and federal statutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What benefits are there?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Save money:</strong>It is important to go through your financial strategy at the beginning of the year when finding tax-saving opportunities and preparing around this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minimize claims and have acquiescence:</strong>pay the taxes you have to pay while avoiding those which do not assure a smooth relationship between the taxpayer and the tax collector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we know, the latter tries to extract the greatest amount possible from the relationship between the two, and the former seeks to conserve as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Financial productivity:</strong>Leading cash from needless tax package frees up money to be used to develop and grow companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Golden Planning Tax Rules:</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Share tax earnings among different members of your family.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Take full advantage of all tax exceptions permitted under the bill.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>Take full advantage of the legal tax deductions and refunds available on the tax-saving investments stipulated.</li>\r\n	<li>Allow optimal use of income that is tax-exempt.</li>\r\n	<li>The easier the schedule, the smarter it is.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>the types of planning:</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When we look at tax planning, the short-term, or the long-term, must be taken into account. There are several different kinds of preparation, but these are the two types of high level:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Short-Term Planning:&nbsp;</strong>tax planning is received &amp; conducted at the end of the financial year in this approach. Company owners&#39; resort to this schedule to legally limit their tax liability after the financial year ends. This approach does not require or discuss long-term responsibilities. It can also, still, result in significant tax savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Long-term planning:</strong>At the beginning of the financial year, long-term tax planning begins and establishes a schedule for the taxpayer to execute throughout the rest of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike short-term planning, this does not produce immediate results, but in the long term, you may save much more. Also, responsible corporations and taxpayers prepare in advance to prevent possible shortcomings later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In brief, it is our perception that every person has the right to take advantage of both state and federal government tax benefits. This is the money you&#39;ve been working hard to raise, and the longer you keep it, the better. Therefore, not only is the income tax package minimized by careful tax preparation and assessment, but you will have more money to ensure the protection of your family and expand your wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study can be difficult, and some may suggest this is by design, but luckily you have<a href=\"https://cpapai.com/\">&nbsp;precision accounting INTL LLC</a>&nbsp;partners who do this for a living and enjoy it.

This is called the &quot;three-year law&quot; and leads many individuals to assume that if they keep their records for this period, they are safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if the IRS suspects that the income has been substantially underreported (by 25 percent or more) or believes that there may be evidence of fraud, the audit may go back six years. Using the following instructions to be safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exceptional circumstances</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Build a backup set of documents and store them electronically. Unique situations It is easier than ever to maintain a backup collection of records&mdash;including, for example, bank accounts, tax returns, insurance plans, etc.&mdash;now that many financial institutions electronically provide statements and documentation, and a great deal of financial information is accessible on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They can be scanned and transferred to a digital format even if the original records are only issued on paper.
