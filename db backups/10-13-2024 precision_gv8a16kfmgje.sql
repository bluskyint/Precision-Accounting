Here are some reasons why individuals choose to work as CPAs:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">1. Professional opportunities: Being a CPA opens up a wide range of professional opportunities. CPAs are in demand in various industries, including public accounting firms, corporate finance departments, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and consulting firms. The skills and knowledge acquired as a CPA can lead to diverse roles such as financial analyst, auditor, tax specialist, forensic accountant, or CFO.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">2. Job security and growth: Accounting and finance are essential functions in every organization. As a result, CPAs often enjoy job security and stability. The demand for accounting professionals tends to remain consistent, and there are opportunities for career advancement and growth within the field.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">3. Competitive salary: CPAs tend to earn competitive salaries compared to many other professions. The combination of specialized knowledge, expertise, and the level of responsibility associated with the role often translates into higher earning potential.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">4. Professional credibility and respect: Achieving the CPA designation requires meeting rigorous educational requirements, passing the CPA exam, and obtaining relevant work experience. This process demonstrates a high level of competence and dedication, which can enhance professional credibility and earn respect from colleagues, clients, and employers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">5. Versatile skill set: The skills acquired as a CPA are transferable and applicable to various aspects of business and finance. CPAs develop expertise in financial reporting, auditing, taxation, budgeting, and analysis, which can be valuable in decision-making, strategic planning, and problem-solving.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">6. Opportunities for specialization: Within the field of accounting, CPAs have the option to specialize in areas such as tax planning, forensic accounting, internal auditing, information systems auditing, or financial consulting. Specialization can provide a deeper understanding of specific industry nuances and open doors to niche career paths.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">7. Entrepreneurial opportunities: Many CPAs choose to start their own accounting practices or consulting firms, leveraging their knowledge and expertise to serve clients directly. Being a self-employed CPA can offer flexibility, autonomy, and the potential for financial rewards.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">8. Continuous learning and development: The accounting profession is dynamic and constantly evolving. CPAs are required to stay updated with changes in accounting standards, taxation laws, and industry regulations.

The IRS has submitted more than 121 million individual tax returns and processed more than 110 million of them as of April 30. The IRS has issued over 81 million tax refund checks to Americans, with an average check of $2,865.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Families also earn the biggest windfall of the year in the form of a refund, which can be used to pay down debt, increase savings, and more. Americans can demand any money they are owed, particularly after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic this year.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">According to Rebecca Thompson, director of the Taxpayer Opportunity Channel at Prosperity Now, a nonprofit, it is crucial to note that a refund is not free money. It is money you owe the US government because you overpaid them, an interest-free loan. You have the right to have it returned, and you should do so.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Although the deadline for filing taxes for this year is May 17, it is also the deadline for claiming any refunds from 2017.

The IRS announced in April that $1.3 billion in unclaimed refunds from 2017 remained unclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“If they don\'t [file], the money is lost, and it becomes a treasury donation,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Get your hands on those credits, and a lot more.&nbsp;</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">There are other reasons this year why filing with the IRS is relevant, even for those who do not usually do so.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For one thing, filing a return and receiving the recovery refund credit is the only way to get any economic benefit payments owed to you, or to get a “topped up” sum if your circumstances changed – for example if you had a baby in 2020 and were eligible for a stimulus check.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Tax reforms were also introduced as part of the American Rescue Plan. For the millions of Americans who lose their jobs because of Covid, the first $10,200 in unemployment insurance is now tax-free for those earning less than $150,000.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Extensions and Penalties&nbsp;</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">If you do not file, you risk losing your refund and incurring fines and interest if you owe the IRS.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“It is important for anybody who believes they would owe to make sure that their tax return is filed or that an extension is filed and approved by the IRS, and that they do so by the filing deadline,” Thompson said. “If they don\'t, they\'ll face fines for failing to register and paying.”&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Of course, even though you file an extension, you can still be subject to penalties for failing to pay your taxes, according to her. Whether you file an extension or not, the payment deadline is May 17.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Even so, some people find that filing an extension is beneficial because the penalty for paying what you owe late is usually minor.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">“There\'s no shame in asking for an extension,” Koester said. To get an extension, you must fill out IRS Form 4868.
